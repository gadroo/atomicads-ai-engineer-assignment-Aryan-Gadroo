â”‚                                                                                                          â”‚

â”‚                                                                                                          â”‚

â”‚ - It's recommended to avoid overly narrow age ranges unless they are specifically relevant to the        â”‚
â”‚ product or service being advertised.                                                                     â”‚

â”‚                                                                                                          â”‚
â”‚ ### Location Targeting                                                                                   â”‚
â”‚ - **Country targeting:** Suitable for achieving a broad reach.                                           â”‚
â”‚ - **Region/state targeting:** Ideal for regional businesses looking to target customers in specific      â”‚
â”‚ states or regions.                                                                                       â”‚
â”‚ - **City targeting:** Best for local businesses, typically targeting within a 10-25 mile radius.         â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                          â”‚
â”‚ ### Interest Targeting                                                                                   â”‚
â”‚ - Advertisers can combine interests to reach people with multiple relevant interests.                    â”‚
â”‚ - Detailed Targeting Expansion can be used to find more relevant audiences.                              â”‚
â”‚ - It's important to remove interests that overlap significantly to avoid narrowing the audience too      â”‚
â”‚ much.                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                          â”‚
â”‚ Additionally, Meta offers other targeting options such as behavior targeting, custom audiences (based on â”‚
â”‚ your own data), lookalike audiences (similar to your best customers), and retargeting to people who have â”‚
â”‚ interacted with your business online or offline. These options allow for a high degree of specificity    â”‚
â”‚ and effectiveness in reaching the right people with your ads.                                            â”‚
