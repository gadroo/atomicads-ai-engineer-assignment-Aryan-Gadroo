â”‚ Effective budgeting strategies for Meta campaigns include:                                               â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                          â”‚
â”‚ 1. **Daily Budgets**: Recommended for ongoing campaigns to ensure a consistent spend rate over time.     â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                          â”‚
â”‚ 2. **Lifetime Budgets**: Better suited for campaigns with fixed start and end dates, allowing you to     â”‚
â”‚ allocate a specific amount to be spent over the duration of the campaign.                                â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                          â”‚
â”‚ 3. **Campaign Budget Optimization (CBO)**: This feature allows Meta to automatically distribute your     â”‚
â”‚ budget across different ad sets to get the best results. It's useful for managing multiple ad sets under â”‚
â”‚ the same campaign.                                                                                       â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                          â”‚
â”‚ When implementing these strategies, it's important to monitor performance and make adjustments as        â”‚
â”‚ needed. For scaling successful campaigns, it's recommended to increase the budget gradually, by about    â”‚
â”‚ 10-20% per day, to maintain performance stability.                                                       â”‚
