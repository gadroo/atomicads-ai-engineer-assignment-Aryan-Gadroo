â”‚                                                                                                                                              â”‚
â”‚ 1. **Choose the Right Campaign Objective**: Select the campaign objective that aligns with your marketing goal. For example, use             â”‚
â”‚ OUTCOME_SALES for conversions or OUTCOME_AWARENESS for brand reach.                                                                          â”‚

â”‚ 2. **Optimization Goals by Objective**: Depending on your chosen objective, optimize for the most relevant goal. For instance:               â”‚
â”‚    - For OUTCOME_AWARENESS, you might optimize for REACH to maximize unique reach.                                                           â”‚
â”‚    - For OUTCOME_SALES, consider optimizing for OFFSITE_CONVERSIONS to focus on website conversions.                                         â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                              â”‚
â”‚ 3. **Budget Optimization**:                                                                                                                  â”‚
â”‚    - Use daily budgets for ongoing campaigns to maintain a consistent spend.                                                                 â”‚
â”‚    - Use lifetime budgets for campaigns with a specific start and end date.                                                                  â”‚
â”‚    - Implement Campaign Budget Optimization (CBO) to allow Meta to distribute your budget efficiently across ad sets.                        â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                              â”‚
â”‚ 4. **Targeting Recommendations**:                                                                                                            â”‚
â”‚    - Adjust your audience size based on the campaign type: broad for awareness, medium for consideration, and narrower for conversions.      â”‚
â”‚    - Use Detailed Targeting Expansion to reach more relevant audiences.                                                                      â”‚
â”‚    - Avoid significant overlap in interests to prevent narrowing your audience excessively.                                                  â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                              â”‚
â”‚ 5. **Ad Creative Best Practices**:                                                                                                           â”‚
â”‚    - Choose the right ad format for your message (e.g., image ads for simple visuals, video ads for engaging content).                       â”‚
â”‚    - For image ads, use a recommended resolution of 1080 x 1080 pixels and keep text minimal.                                                â”‚
â”‚    - For video ads, aim for a length of 5-15 seconds and include captions, as many videos are watched without sound.                         â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                              â”‚

â”‚    - Write concise headlines (5-6 words, less than 40 characters).                                                                           â”‚
â”‚    - Keep the primary text brief (1-2 short sentences, 125 characters or less).                                                              â”‚
â”‚    - Use a succinct description (30 characters or less).                                                                                     â”‚
â”‚    - Use clear, action-oriented call-to-action buttons.                                                                                      â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                              â”‚
â”‚ 7. **Character Limits**: Adhere to the character limits for campaign names, ad set names, ad names, headlines, primary text, descriptions,   â”‚
â”‚ and call-to-action button text to ensure your message is clear and not truncated.                                                            â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                              â”‚
â”‚ 8. **Call to Action Options**: Choose a call-to-action button that matches your campaign's intent, such as SHOP_NOW for sales or LEARN_MORE  â”‚
â”‚ for informational content.                                                                                                                   â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                              â”‚
