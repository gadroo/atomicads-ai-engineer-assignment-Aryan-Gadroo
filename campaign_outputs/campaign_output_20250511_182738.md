Important Notes:
1. All placeholders ({{...}}) must be replaced with valid IDs before API submission
2. Ensure all referenced IDs (interests, page, ad creative) exist and are accessible
3. Follow the creation order in metadata.json for proper ID dependencies
4. Using Meta Marketing API version v18.0 (as of May 2025)
5. Campaign uses lifetime budget instead of daily budget
6. Campaign dates are set to future dates
7. Interest IDs are validated against Meta's targeting options

Campaign Reasoning:

audience_analysis:
Targeting fitness enthusiasts aged 28-50 aligns with the demographic that typically invests in high-end 
fitness equipment. The interests selected focus on home workouts and premium fitness gear, ensuring 
relevance to the product.

creative_strategy:
The ad copy emphasizes the exclusivity and quality of the fitness equipment, appealing to the target 
audience's desire for premium products. The call to action encourages immediate engagement.

budget_rationale:
A lifetime budget of $1000 is appropriate for testing the campaign over a month, allowing for sufficient 
reach and engagement within the target audience.

expected_performance:
With the selected optimization goal of OFFSITE_CONVERSIONS, we expect to drive significant traffic to the 
product page, leading to increased sales.
