Important Notes:
1. All placeholders ({{...}}) must be replaced with valid IDs before API submission
2. Ensure all referenced IDs (interests, page, ad creative) exist and are accessible
3. Follow the creation order in metadata.json for proper ID dependencies
4. Using Meta Marketing API version v18.0 (as of May 2025)
5. Campaign uses lifetime budget instead of daily budget
6. Campaign dates are set to future dates
7. Interest IDs are validated against Meta's targeting options

Campaign Reasoning:

audience_analysis:
Targeting fitness enthusiasts aged 28-50 aligns with the demographic most likely to invest in premium 
fitness gear. The interests selected focus on home workouts and premium fitness, ensuring relevance.

creative_strategy:
The ad copy emphasizes the transformation and quality of the fitness equipment, appealing to the target 
audience's desire for high-end products.

budget_rationale:
A lifetime budget of $1000 is appropriate for a sales campaign targeting a specific audience, allowing for 
sufficient reach and frequency over the campaign duration.

expected_performance:
With effective targeting and compelling creative, we expect to see a significant increase in conversions, 
particularly from users interested in premium fitness solutions.
