## üß† LLM Automation MVP
### Project Brief
AI-Powered Campaign Creator for a Social Platform

### üéØ Objective
Build a Python tool or script that takes a structured campaign brief and programmatically creates a campaign in one of the major social ad platforms (Meta, TikTok, LinkedIn, etc.) using their public APIs.
- Accepts user input for a task (necessary information required to build the campaign) through cli/UI
- Uses an LLM(open source or public api based LLM) to perform the task using prompt engineering (maybe finetune the LLM, for this use case)
- Finishes with a working prototype, that is able to generate a advertisement campaign on the social media with minimal imput.

### ‚úÖ Tasks
1. Prompt Engineering & LLM Integration  
2. Model Tuning or Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
3. MVP creation for AI powered campaign generation for one or more major social ad platform.
